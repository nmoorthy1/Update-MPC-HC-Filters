# Update-MPC-HC-Filters

To use this, make sure you are currently already updated to the newest madVR and LAV Filters. Download all three files and make sure that all are in the same directory. Run update.py and it will check if there are newer versions and download the LAV exe and the madVR zip file and extract it. Run the exe to update LAV and move the madVR folder to your current installation location of madVR.
