# Update MPC-HC Filters

This is used to easily check for updates for your [madVR](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=146228) and [LAV Filters](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=156191) external filters for [Media Player Classic-Home Cinema](https://nightly.mpc-hc.org/).

## Requirements

Python >= 3.3

## Usage
    >>> update.py


To use this, run update.py and for the first run, it will create madvrver and lavver files as well as download the most recent versions of madVR and LAV Filters. Run the exe to update LAV and move the madVR folder to your current installation location of madVR. For every subsequent run, make sure madvrver and lavver are in the same directory as update.py as it needs these to check if there are newer versions available.
